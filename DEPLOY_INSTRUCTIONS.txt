# STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR JINBE BOT

## METHOD 1: GITHUB + RENDER (RECOMMENDED)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: jinbe-bot
3. Make it PRIVATE (to protect your code)
4. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub
Open PowerShell in your project folder and run these commands ONE BY ONE:

cd "e:\Discord Bots\Jinbe"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jinbe-bot.git
git push -u origin main

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

### Step 3: Deploy on Render
1. Go to https://render.com/
2. Sign up/Login with GitHub
3. Click "New +" → "Background Worker"
4. Connect your GitHub repository (jinbe-bot)
5. Configure:
   - Name: jinbe-discord-bot
   - Environment: Python 3
   - Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Start Command: python jinbe.py
6. Add Environment Variable:
   - Key: DISCORD_TOKEN
   - Value: YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
7. Click "Create Background Worker"

Your bot will be online in 2-3 minutes!

## METHOD 2: RAILWAY (ALTERNATIVE)

1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your jinbe-bot repository
5. Add Environment Variable:
   - DISCORD_TOKEN = your_token_here
6. Railway will auto-detect and deploy

## IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Free tier on Render may have limitations
- Use paid tier ($7/month) for guaranteed 24/7 uptime
- Never share your DISCORD_TOKEN publicly
- The .gitignore file prevents .env from being uploaded to GitHub

## TROUBLESHOOTING:

If bot doesn't start:
1. Check logs in Render dashboard
2. Verify DISCORD_TOKEN is correct
3. Ensure all files are uploaded
4. Check if requirements.txt is present

## SUPPORT:

If you need help, check the Render/Railway documentation or Discord bot guides.
